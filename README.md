# Wireless and Mobile Networks Calculator

This repository contains the source code for an Android application developed as part of the ENCS5323 course in Electrical & Computer Engineering. The application provides a set of calculators tailored for key calculations in wireless and mobile networks.

## Features

- **PSK Calculator**
  - Supports BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, and 16-PSK modulation schemes.
  - Calculates Bit Error Rate (BER) based on various input parameters.
  - Validation scenarios include typical cases, boundary values, and approximations.

- **ALOHA Calculator**
  - Simulates the performance of Pure ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA protocols.
  - Provides insights into the throughput and efficiency under different network conditions.
  - Test cases cover typical scenarios and boundary conditions.

- **GOS Calculator**
  - Estimates the Grade of Service (GOS) for cellular networks.
  - Determines the optimal number of channels or trunks for a given setup.
  - Includes validation scenarios for typical GOS values, approximations, and capacity limits.
